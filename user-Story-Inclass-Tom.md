# User Story

## Who is the user

Tom is a 76 year old software developer who still hasn't retired. He has been coding since the early days, optimizing in assembly language and working on mainframes.

## What do they want to do with the tool

Tom wants a tool that can help him reminice about the old days of programming. He wants to be able to write and run code in various old programming languages, such as COBOL, Fortran, and Assembly. He also wants to be able to see how his code would have performed on the hardware of that era.

## What needs and desires do they want for the tool

Different from the time period, Tom wants a tool that is more user-friendly and accessible than the programming environments of the past. He desires features like:

- A modern IDE with syntax highlighting and code completion for old programming languages.
- An easy way to simulate the hardware of the past, including mainframes and early personal computers.
- Access to a library of old code examples and documentation to help him get started.
- The ability to share his code and collaborate with others who have similar interests.

## What is their skill level

Tom is an experienced programmer with a deep understanding of computer science concepts. However, he may not be familiar with modern programming paradigms and tools, so the tool should provide guidance and support for him to adapt to the current landscape.
